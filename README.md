# Clippit
UCB Final Project

A mock shop called "CLIPPIT" to show our modern booking platform. 

Our application is design for barber shop and salons to integrate an easy-to-use scheduling platform with their websites. 

We came up with this idea because our own local shops are using outdated sites or still using booklet to keep track of appointments. 

Once user enter the website, our home page will show. In order to book an appointment or to view certain aspect of the site, the user will be prompt to login or sign up if they do not have an account. 

Once user have logged in, they can easily go to the book appointment page to schedule their appointment. 

* 1 Choose their date from the calendar. 
* 2 Then choose stylist of their choice. 
* 3 Pick a time that best fit their schedule. 

A confirmation modal will pop up to confirm their appointment. 

The user will then be routed to their upcoming appointment page to view their newly made appointment.
